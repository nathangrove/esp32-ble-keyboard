# esp32-ble-keyboard

This is the firmware that runs on my homemade bluetooth mechanical keyboard.

It allows mutliple (up to 10) bluetooth device MACs to switch between connected devices with the press of a button.

## TODO
- Add embedded webserver for custom macro and keymap uploads without special computer software
- Optimize key press detection
- Add real voltage reporting 
- Add shift registers to help with accuracy/performance of key detection
